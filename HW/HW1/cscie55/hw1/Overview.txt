Title: Elevator Simulation

"Brief Description:"

The elevator stars on the "0th Floor" which is ground level.

The passengers are loaded using the boardPassengers method giving it arbitrary values.

Then, those values are stored in an array called destination_requests where the value of each index increases
the more people request that floor and decreases as people get off.

If the Elevator is request for a specific floor the move method calls stop instead of
going up and increasing the current_floor number.

The stop method calls the departPassengers method where the passangers get off the current floor
The move method is called to reanimate the Elevator.

This process stops once the loop cycles through.


"Goals:"

To get the desired output from the spec

"See Also:"
N/A


"Assumptions:"

The passengers are loaded from the first floor before the elevator moves.
There was no set destination for the passengers.
I made the wild assumption that there was some relationship between the passengers, the stops and the floors but I couldn't seem to mimic this algorithm to the test output exactly.


"Current procedure/functionality:"

It compiles and the logic for input and output are valid, it unfortunately stray from the exact output as specified.

"How things work now:"

staying within the boundaries set by the number of floors is this relationship between floors and the number of passengars on them.



"How to run the assignment:"

From your parent directory, compile first by running:

javac cscie55/hw1/*.java

Then follow up by running:

java -cp . cscie55.hw1.ElevatorTest
