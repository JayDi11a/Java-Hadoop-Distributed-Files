"Brief Description:"\
- This homework assignment introduces a Passenger class and a restructuring on how we are monitoring them via the Floor and Elevator class as collections. We also focus on sharpening the simulation of passenger travel in relation to an elevators movement.\
\
\
"Goals:"\
- We need to add Passenger collections to the Floor Class and change the logic in other classes that dealt with single passenger objects and rewrite it for collections of Passengers. We need to create a Passenger Class of course. Once we have successfully gone through the check list of requirements, we run the JUnit testing for verification.\
\
\
"See Also:"\
- N/A\
\
\
"Assumptions:"\
 - I assume that the Building Class was still sufficient from last assignment as well as the ElevatorFullException Class.\
\
\
"Current procedure/functionality:"\
- (See \'93How things work now\'94)\
\
\
"How things work now:"\
- Everything seems to be working. I get varying JUnit testing times but they appear to complete Ok.\
\
\
"How to run the assignment:"\
- From your parent directory, compile first by running:\
\
1.) export CLASSPATH=(wherever your .jar files are)\
2.) run the compilation from both your hw3 directory and your hw3test directory\
3.) \CocoaLigature0 java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore cscie55.hw2test.HW3ElevatorSimulationTest\CocoaLigature1 \
