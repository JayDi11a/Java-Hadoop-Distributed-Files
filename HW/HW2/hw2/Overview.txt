"Brief Description:"\
\
- There are two new objects that were asked to be created: The Building and Floor. The Elevator and the Floor are both part of the building. There is now a limit to the amount of passengers that the elevator can carry and it introduced an exception class that needed to be built to handle that.\
\
\
"Goals:"\
- For me, I didn\'92t feel like my Elevator object was written in a way where I could build a Floor and Building object so I pretty much had to rewrite it after redoing HW1 and then changing it from that.\
\
\
"See Also:"\
- N/A\
\
\
"Assumptions:"\
 - \
\
\
"Current procedure/functionality:"\
- With the addition of the Building and Floor objects, and then having to rewrite the Elevator object around it including the exception handling it all appears to compile. Next was introducing a hw2test package and then JUnit testing. This gets back to the issues I had with creating a class path for the JUnit .jar files.\
\
\
"How things work now:"\
- Everything seems to be working. I get varying JUnit testing times but they appear to complete Ok.\
\
\
"How to run the assignment:"\
\
- From your parent directory, compile first by running:\
\
1.) export CLASSPATH=(wherever your .jar files are)\
2.) run the compilation\
